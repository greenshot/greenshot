About this repository
---------------------
This repository is for Greenshot 1.3.x

* Due to the update of .NET 4.5 a lot of bugs are solved
* Added Windows 10 destinations, OCR & share
* Better DPI support
* Faster development
* Bug fixes


For developers, the major changes since 1.2.x are:
* Updated to .NET 4.5.x
* Moved logging from log4net to [Dapplo.Log](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.Log) which is a very simple logger
* Using Dependency Injection (Inversion of Control), via [Dapplo.Addons](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.Addons) which bases upon MEF.
* Add-ins (formerly plug-ins) can just place attributes on classes to be loaded and injected.
* Started using WPF via MVVM, provided by Caliburn.Micro via [Dapplo.CaliburnMicro](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.CaliburnMicro)
* Added [Dapplo.Config](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.Config) which provides language & configuration support.
* Added a configuration UI, which is build together via composition. Meaning add-ins just need to implement the correct class and use the correct attributes to be visible inside the new configuration.
* Using [Dapplo.HttpExtensions](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.HttpExtensions) as the default HTTP client library, which should make it easier to use cloud services.
* Fody-Costura is supported for add-ins, which make it possible to simply embed the needed dependencies as dlls.
* Moved most native windows code to a separate project called [Dapplo.Windows](https://github.com/dapplo/Dapplo.Windows) which makes it easier to test
* Moved graphics code to a separate project, where benchmark tests are possible.

Currently known errors:
* The old .greenshot files cannot be loaded

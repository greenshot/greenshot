<h2>Creating a screenshot</h2>
<p>
		You can create a screenshot either by using the <kbd>Print</kbd> key on your keyboard<br />
		or by right clicking the Greenshot icon in the notification area.<br><br />
		There are several options for creating a screenshot:
	</p>
<p>	<a name="capture-region"></a></p>
<h3>Capture region <kbd>Print</kbd></h3>
<p>
		The region capture mode allows you to select a part of you screen to be shot.<br><br />
		After starting region mode, you will see a crosshair pointing out the mouse<br />
		position on the screen. Click and hold where you want one of the corners of your<br />
		screenshot to be. Still holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse to define<br />
		the rectangle to be shot. When the green rectangle covers the area you want to<br />
		be captured in your screenshot, release the mouse button.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		You can use the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to switch between region and <a href="#capture-window">window</a> mode.<br />
		Holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while capturing fixes one dimension of the selection rectangle.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
	If you want to capture an exact area, you can use the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to adjust the mouse cursor
	position pixel-wise, or by 10 pixels if you hold down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key. Hit <kbd>Return</kbd> to apply the
	start/end position of the selected region. You can toggle the magnifying glass by hitting <kbd>Z</kbd>.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="capture-last-region"></a></p>
<h3>Capture last region <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd></h3>
<p>
		If you did a <a href="#capture-region">region</a> or <a href="#capture-window">window</a> capture 
		before, you can capture the same region again using this option.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="capture-window"></a></p>
<h3>Capture window <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd></h3>
<p>
		Creates a screenshot of the window which is currently active.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		The <a href="#settings">settings dialog</a> offers an option not to capture<br />
		the active window right away, but allowing you to select one interactively.<br />
		If this option is selected, you may select a window by clicking it (As in<br />
		<a href="#capture-region">region mode</a>, Greenshot will highlight the area<br />
		that will be captured).<br>If you want a child window to be captured (e.g. a browser<br />
		viewport (without toolsbars etc.) or a single frame of a web page using framesets)<br />
		point the mouse cursor to the window and hit the <kbd>PgDown</kbd> key. After<br />
		doing so, you can select child elements of the window to be captured.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		Capturing context menus on their own is different: using the "Capture window"<br />
		shortcut would make the context menu disappear, and obviously the same would happen<br />
		if you used Greenshot's context menu in order to create the screenshot. If you want<br />
		to capture a context menu you have just brought up by right-clicking anything,<br />
		simply activate region mode <kbd>Print</kbd>, then press the <kbd>Space</kbd> key.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="capture-fullscreen"></a></p>
<h3>Capture fullscreen <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd></h3>
<p>
		Creates a screenshot of the complete screen.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="capture-ie"></a></p>
<h3>Capture Internet Explorer <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd></h3>
<p>
		Comfortably creates a screenshot of a web page currently opened in Internet Explorer.<br />
		Use Greenshot's context menu to select the Internet Explorer tab to capture, or hit<br />
		<kbd>Crtl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd> to capture the active tab.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor"></a></p>
<h2>Using the image editor</h2>
<p>
		Greenshot comes with an easy-to-use image editor, providing a handy featureset<br />
		to add annotations or shapes to a screenshot. It even allows to highlight or<br />
		obfuscate parts of your screenshot.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		Greenshot's image editor may not only be used for screenshots. You can also<br />
		open images for editing from a file or from clipboard. Simply right click<br />
		the Greenshot icon in the notification area and select <em>Open image from file</em><br />
		or <em>Open image from clipboard</em>, respectively.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		By default, the image editor will be opened whenever a screenshot is<br />
		captured. If you do not want to use the image editor, you can disable this<br />
		behavior in the <a href="#settings">settings dialog</a>.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		If one or more editor windows are already open and Greenshot is configured to open
		the destination picker for new screenshots, you can briefly hover the mouse cursor
	over the entry <em>Open in image editor</em> to reveal a list of all open editor windows
	to choose from. The new screenshot will be inserted as separate object into the selected editor.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor-shapes"></a></p>
<h3>Drawing shapes</h3>
<p>
		Select one of the shape drawing tools from the toolbar on the left hand side<br />
		of the image editor or from the <em>Object</em> menu. There is also a key assigned<br />
		to each tool for your convenience.<br><br />
		Available shapes are: rectangle <kbd>R</kbd>, ellipse <kbd>E</kbd>, line <kbd>L</kbd>,<br />
		arrow <kbd>A</kbd> and freehand line <kbd>F</kbd>.<br><br />
		Click, hold down the mouse button and drag to define position and size of the shape.<br />
		Release the mouse button when you are done.
	</p>
<p>
		You can move or resize existing shapes after selecting the selection tool<br />
		<kbd>ESC</kbd> from the toolbar. The elements can also be moved by using the <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys, 
		also in combination	with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key.<br>
		For every element type there is a specific<br />
		set of options available to change the look of the element (e.g. line thickness,<br />
		line color, fill color). You can change the options for an existing element after<br />
		selecting it, but also for the next element to be drawn after selecting a drawing tool.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		You can select multiple elements for editing or positioning at a time. In order to select multiple<br />
		elements, hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while clicking the elements.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		If you want to draw equilateral shapes (e.g. force a rectangle to be a square) hold<br />
		down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while drawing. When drawing lines or arrows, holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd><br />
		results in the line's angle being rounded in steps 15Â°.<br><br />
		You can also use <kbd>Shift</kbd> if you want to resize an existing object maintaining it's aspect ratio.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		When drawing or scaling, you can hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to have the object anchored in<br />
		it's geometrical middle. I.e. the object is resized in the opposite direction, too. (This<br />
		is very handy if you want to draw an ellipse around something on your screenshot.)
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor-text"></a></p>
<h3>Adding text</h3>
<p>
		Usage of the text tool <kbd>T</kbd> is similar to the usage of the<br />
		<a href="#editor-shapes">shape</a> tools. Just draw the text element to the desired<br />
		size, then type in the text.<br><br />
		Double click an existing text element to edit the text.<br><br />
		Hit <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> when you have finished editing.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		If you need to insert line breaks within a text box, hit <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> or<br />
	<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Backspace</kbd> delete the previous word, 
	<kbd>Ctrl></kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> selects to complete text.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor-highlight"></a></p>
<h3>Highlighting things</h3>
<p>
		After selecting the highlight tool <kbd>H</kbd>, you can define the area to be<br />
		highlighted exactly like you would draw a <a href="#editor-shapes">shape</a>.<br><br />
		There are several options for highlighting, which you can choose from by clicking<br />
		the leftmost button in the toolbar on top:
	</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Highlight text</em>: highlights an area by applying a bright color to it, like<br />
			an office text highlighter</li>
<li><em>Highlight area</em>: blurs<a href="#hint-blur">*</a> and darkens everything outside the selected area</li>
<li><em>Grayscale</em>: everything outside the selected area will be turned to grayscale</li>
<li><em>Magnify</em>: the selected area will be displayed magnified</li>
</ul>
<p>	<a name="editor-obfuscate"></a></p>
<h3>Obfuscating things</h3>
<p>
		Obfuscating parts of a screenshot is a good idea if it contains data which is not<br />
		intended for other people to see, e.g. bank account data, names, passwords or faces on images.<br><br />
		Use the obfuscate tool <kbd>O</kbd> exactly like the <a href="#editor-highlight">highlight</a> tool.<br />
		Available options for obfuscation are:
	</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pixelize</em>: increases the pixel size for the selected area</li>
<li><em>Blur</em><a href="#hint-blur">*</a>: blurs the selected area</li>
</ul>
<p>	<a name="hint-blur"></a></p>
<p class="hint">
		* Depeding on the performance of your computer, applying a blur effect might slow down<br />
		Greenshot's image editor. If you feel the image editor reacting slowly as soon as a<br />
		blur is applied, try reducing the value for <em>Preview quality</em> in the toolbar or<br />
		decrease the value for <em>Blur radius</em>.<br><br />
		If the blur performance is still too bad for you to work with, you might prefer<br />
		to use the pixelize effect instead.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor-crop"></a></p>
<h3>Cropping the screenshot</h3>
<p>
		If you only need a part of the screenshot you have captured, use the crop tool <kbd>C</kbd><br />
		to crop it to the desired area.<br><br />
		After selecting the crop tool, draw a rectangle for the area of the screenshot you want<br />
		to keep. You can resize the selected area like any other element.<br><br />
		When you are content with your selection, use the confirm button in the toolbar or hit<br />
		the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the <kbd>Return</kbd> key. You can cancel cropping by clicking the cancel button or hitting <kbd>ESC</kbd>.<br>
		<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> immediately crops the area to match all existing elements.
	</p>
<p class="hint">
		<em>Auto-Crop</em>: If you need to crop a border of solid background color from your screenshot,<br />
		simply choose <em>Auto-Crop</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu and Greenshot will automatically<br />
		select the area for cropping.
	</p>
	<a name="editor-enlarge"></a>
	<h3>Enlarge screenshot</h3>
	<p>
		In order to enlarge the screenshot, hit <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>, which will add 25 pixels to all four sides.
	</p>   
<p>	<a name="editor-adding-graphics"></a></p>
<h3>Adding graphics to a screenshot</h3>
<p>
		You can simply add graphics or images to your screenshot by dragging and dropping an image<br />
		file into the editor window. You can also insert screenshots of other windows by selecting<br />
		<em>Insert window</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu. A list of all open windows appears,<br />
		allowing you to select one for insertion. Insert an image from the clipboard by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> works as well.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor-reuse-elements"></a></p>
<h3>Re-using drawn elements</h3>
<p>
		If you find yourself using the same or similar elements on most of your screenshots<br />
		(e.g. a textfield containing browser type and version, or obfuscating the same<br />
		element on several screenshots) you can re-use elements.<br><br />
		Select <em>Save objects to file</em> from the <em>Object</em> menu to save the current<br />
		set of elements for re-using it later. <em>Load objects from file</em> applies the<br />
		same elements to another screenshot.
	</p>
<p>	<a name="editor-export"></a></p>
<h3>Exporting the screenshot</h3>
<p>
		After editing the screenshot, you can export the result for different purposes,<br />
		depending on your needs. You can access all export options through the <em>File</em><br />
		menu, the topmost toolbar or via shortcuts:
	</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Save</em> <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>: saves the image to a file (if the image has already been saved, else displays <em>Save as...</em> dialog)</li>
<li><em>Save as...</em> <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>: lets you choose location, filename and image format for the file to save</li>
<li><em>Copy image to clipboard</em> <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>: puts a copy of the image into the clipboard, allowing to paste into other programs</li>
<li><em>Print...</em> <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>: sends the image to a printer</li>
<li><em>E-Mail</em> <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>: opens a new message in your default e-mail client, adding the image as attachment</li>
</ul>
<p class="hint">
		After saving an image from the editor, right-click the status bar at the bottom of<br />
		the editor window to either copy the file path into the clipboard or open the<br />
		containing directory in Windows Explorer.

To turn off logging, locate the file log4net.xml, which is located in the same folder as the Greenshot.exe file. Create a backup of that file and open it in a text editor. (Note: if Greenshot is installed in your "Programs" directory, you might need to do this as Windows administrator.)

Instead of

    <level value="INFO"/>
    
you can insert

    <level value="OFF"/>
    
to turn off logging completey or

    <level value="ERROR"/>
    
to turn on error logging.
